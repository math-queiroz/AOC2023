# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2023 ðŸ¦€
My solutions to the edition of the year 2023 of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) calendar of programming puzzles. My approach is pretty casual, I just want to get used to Rust and learn stuff.

## How to Use
Feel free to run this code by yourself. Inputs goes on the `input` folder (be sure their names ends in `.txt`). Given you have [Rust Tools](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) installed and set up, just run the following command to run all days in sequence
```sh
cargo run --release
```
Or, if you rather, run specfic days by replacing the `XX` on the following command
```sh
cargo run --bin XX --release
```

## Fetch
The way I automated fetching `inputs` and `prompts` is by using my simple [AOCFetcher](https://github.com/math-queiroz/AOCFetcher)
